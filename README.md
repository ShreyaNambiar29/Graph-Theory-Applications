# Graph Algorithms in Real-Life Applications

This repo contains Python implementations for four graph problems:
1. Social Network Friend Suggestion — BFS (friends of friends)
2. Route Finding (Google Maps) — Bellman-Ford (handles negative weights)
3. Emergency Response Route — Dijkstra (positive weights, min-heap)
4. Network Cable Installation — MST using Kruskal & Prim

Files:
- graph_realworld.py  # main implementations + demos
- requirements.txt    # optional extra libraries

How to run:
$ python graph_realworld.py

Profiling:
- The code measures execution time (time.perf_counter) and memory usage (tracemalloc snapshots).
- For more detailed memory profiling, install `memory_profiler` and use as desired.
